# Carousel Coding Challenge submission

Please note, I have decided to use AI assistance ([Claude](https://claude.ai/)) as practice (while reviewing its output and making necessary changes). It was very helpful, especially with:

* the unit tests (I do not have much practice with unit testing at Optus) 
* the carousel (I have created a carousel in the past [(desktop only)](https://nextjs-desktop-carousel.vercel.app/), and this time round, I wanted to see how much AI assistance could help)
* Styled Components - I do not have much practice with this library.
* Webpack - I do not much experience with this bundler.

If I were to spend more time with this, I would have used: 

* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) instead of Styled Components as I like using existing utility classes, and I have much practice of using this from Optus. 
* [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) instead of React Context, as there is minimal boilerplace required, so much simpler to use for a simple project such as this one. 

If I had spent more time, I would have implemented a mobile-friendly version, designed the UI so that it is more like the sample screenshots, and make better test cases. 

Overall, it was a great challenge and I enjoyed the experience with AI assistance; though sometimes a bit annoying, I can see myself using it as a tool for better productivity in future projects.
